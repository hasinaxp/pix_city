//
// Three kinds of light, and they are deliberately different things rather than
// one general case:
//
//   sun      one directional light, the only one that casts a shadow map. It is
//            by far the brightest thing in a daytime scene and it is what the
//            cascades are built around.
//   sky      an environment, not a light: a hemisphere of diffuse irradiance
//            plus a dome colour that every glossy surface reflects. Analytic,
//            so the backdrop, the reflections in a car roof and the reflection
//            in the river are all the same function evaluated three times.
//   punctual point and spot lights - street lamps, headlights, shop windows.
//            Gathered per frame and culled to the ones nearest the camera.
